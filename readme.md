# Open Journaling

Often times while working on systems it is extremely helpful, if not essential, to have a complete record of interactions. Whether those interactions are categorized as commands, events, or both is anything from a matter of preference to a deeply held dogma.  This is an mechanism for doing that.  

_[journal](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/journal)_  

> A chronological record of changes made to a database or other system; along with a backup or image copy that allows recovery after a failure or reinstatement to a previous time; a log.
